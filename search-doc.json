Also open the browser's console for more info. Can I host it in a shared hosting? If you are unable to run php artisan migrate --seed or any artisan command in your shared hosting, you can run the command in browser. The url is: yourdomain.com/command/. Migration command would look like domain.com/command/migrate --seed.Make sure APP_ENV is set to local in .env file. My site url has /public. What should I do? Look for .htaccess files in your public_html (or your domain root folder). By default, dotfiles are hidden in your file manager. If you still cannot find the .htaccess file, create a new file from file manager, named .htaccess. After you open the .htaccess file, add the following code: <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L] </IfModule> Copy Click to save your changes. After this, you and your visitors should be able to access your app without /public url. Keep in mind that you might have to clear your browser cache.","keywords":""},{"title":"Installation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/installation","content":"Clone the repoRun composer install (make sure you have composer installed)Run npm installRun cp .env.example .envProvide db name, username and password in .envRun php artisan migrate --seed","keywords":""},{"title":"Requirements","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/requirements","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Server Requirements","type":1,"pageTitle":"Requirements","url":"docs/requirements#server-requirements","content":"PHP Version ^7.3|^8.0Dom PHP ExtensionPdo PHP ExtensionPdo_mysql PHP ExtensionMbstring PHP ExtensionTokenizer PHP ExtensionJSON PHP ExtensionFileinfo PHP Extension "},{"title":"Folder Permissions","type":1,"pageTitle":"Requirements","url":"docs/requirements#folder-permissions","content":"storage/framework/ 775storage/logs/ 775bootstrap/cache/ 775 "},{"title":"Screenshots","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/screenshots","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Admin Panel","type":1,"pageTitle":"Screenshots","url":"docs/screenshots#admin-panel","content":"Login page with forget password option.
